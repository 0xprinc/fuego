# Validation

Validation is the process of ensuring that the data provided to the application is correct and meaningful. This is important because the application will use this data to make decisions and take actions. If the data is incorrect or meaningless, the application will not work as expected.

With fuego, you have several options for validating data.

- struct tags with go-validator
- custom validation functions
